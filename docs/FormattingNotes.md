Documentation Notes

We are using sphinx's extension auto-doc to generate module documentation.
The format for this is "numpy".
It is available in PyCharm and also in Sublime with the AutoDocstring package.

Good examples of what the formatting should look like are here:
https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example.html

A full guide to usage is here:
https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html

The standard is described here:(this is the most complete description)
https://numpydoc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/format.html#docstring-standard
